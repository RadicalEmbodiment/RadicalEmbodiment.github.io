<h1>DIRECTIONS OF RADICAL EMBODIMENT</h1>

<h2>19-21 June, 2024 - Universidad de Murcia (Spain)</h2>

<p>The topic of the meeting is radical embodiment writ large. We use the term “radical embodiment” to refer to various flavours of embodied cognition, enactivism, ecological psychology, etc. The main idea is to touch upon different directions in which these theories are expanding or can expand (e.g., neuroscience, social psychology, language, developmental psychology, artificial intelligence, and so on).</p>
