<h3 style="text-align:justify;">How to get to Murcia?</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>From Europe/Outside Europe:</b> The best option is to fly to the <a href="https://www.aena.es/en/alicante-elche-miguel-hernandez.html">Alicante Airport (ALC)</a> and then getting to the city via bus or train. The commute from ALC is ∼1 hour. Another option is to fly to the <a href="https://www.corveraairporttravel.com">Murcia Airport (RMU)</a> and then getting to the city via taxi. The commute from RMU is ∼30 munites but usually more expensive than from ALC.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Where can you stay?</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Hotels:</b> Hotels are always the most expensive option, but Murcia is a <em>relatively</em> cheap city. You can find a room in some of the best hotels in the city center for ~70 euros per night (there are also cheaper options, of course). Three examples are:<br>
 <span>&#8226;</span> <a href="https://www.hesperia.com/es/hoteles/espana/murcia/hotel-hesperia-murcia-centro">Hotel Hesperia</a>, just around the corner from the cathedral.<br>
 <span>&#8226;</span> <a href="https://www.elchurra.net/el-churra/">Hotel El Churra</a>, a good & cheap option at walking distance to the city center.<br>
 <span>&#8226;</span> <a href="https://www.barcelo.com/es-es/barcelo-murcia-siete-coronas/">Hotel Barceló Murcia Siete Coronas</a>, near to the river and the courthouse.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Hostels and Other:</b> Less expensive options include the typical renting/sharing options (e.g., AirBnB, CouchSurfing) as well as hostels. There are a few hostels in Murcia in which you can stay for ~40 euros per night. Two examples are:<br>
 <span>&#8226;</span> <a href="https://thecathedralhostel.com">The Cathedral Hostel</a>, just around the corner from the cathedral. This is the best option if you want to be close to everywhere in the city.<br>
 <span>&#8226;</span> <a href="https://www.lacasaverdehostel.com/rooms">La Casa Verde Hostel</a>, in the middle of the Murcian orchad. It would take ~30 minutes walking to get to the city center. At some points of the day, specially at night, you'll likely need a taxi to get there.</p>
